### The explanation of the fit method:

The fit method initializes the model parameters, then iterates through samples to update w and b to maximize the margin between classes, for a number of epochs defined by n_iter.

def fit(self, X, y):

This is the header for the fit method, which takes in the features X and labels y.

N, n_features = X.shape

Gets the number of samples N and number of features n_features from the shape of X. 

y = np.where(y<=0, -1, 1)

Separates the labels y into -1 and 1 for the two classes.

self.w = np.zeros(n_features) 

Initializes the weights vector w to zeros, of size number of features.

self.b = 0

Initializes the bias b to 0.

for _ in range(self.n_iter):

Starts a for loop to iterate the training for n_iter number of times.

for idx, x_idx in enumerate(X):

Loops through each sample x_idx in X.

condition = y[idx] * (np.dot(x_idx, self.w) - self.b) >= 1

Checks if sample is on correct side of margin based on sign of dot product. 

if condition:

If sample is on correct side, update just weights.

self.w -= self.lr * (2 * self.lambda_param * self.w)

else:

If on wrong side, update both weights and bias. 

self.w -= self.lr * ( (2 * self.lambda_param * self.w) + ((1/N) * np.dot(y[idx], x_idx)) )
self.b -= self.lr * y[idx]

This implements the SGD update step to learn the optimal w and b.
