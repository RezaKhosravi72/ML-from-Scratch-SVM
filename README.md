## Support Vector Machine (SVM) from Scratch

### Project Overview:

The "Support Vector Machine (SVM) from Scratch" project demonstrates the implementation of a binary classification SVM from the ground up in Python. SVM is a powerful machine learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. This project focuses on its application to binary classification.

### Implementation Details:

#### Custom SVM Class:

- A custom SVM class is created to encapsulate the SVM functionality. This class is designed for binary classification tasks.

#### Constructor:

- The SVM class is initialized with parameters such as learning rate, lambda (regularization parameter), and the number of iterations (epochs).

#### Training Data:

- The project imports synthetic training data using the datasets.make_blobs function from scikit-learn. This data consists of two classes and two features. Class labels are converted to -1 and 1 for SVM classification.

#### SVM Training:

- The fit method in the SVM class is responsible for training the model.
- The SVM model is trained using a gradient descent approach. It optimizes a decision boundary to separate the two classes.
- The core idea of SVM, maximizing the margin between classes, is implemented in this step.

#### Prediction:

- The prediction method in the SVM class allows for making predictions on new data points after the model is trained.

#### Visualization:

- To visualize the SVM's decision boundary and support vectors, the project includes a visualization function.
- This function plots the data points, the decision boundary, and margins.

### Code Overview:

- The custom SVM class is constructed with the ability to train and predict.
- A synthetic dataset is generated for training.
- The SVM is trained from scratch using a gradient descent approach.
- The visualization function demonstrates the effectiveness of the trained SVM by displaying the decision boundary, support vectors, and data points.

### Key Takeaways:

- Implementing a Support Vector Machine from scratch allows a deeper understanding of the algorithm's inner workings.
- The project showcases how a gradient descent optimization method can be applied to train an SVM for binary classification.
- Visualizing the decision boundary and margins helps illustrate the SVM's ability to find an optimal separation between classes.


On the whole, this project is a valuable project of mine as it not only demonstrates my proficiency in machine learning but also my ability to construct essential algorithms from the ground up. It serves as a testament to a strong foundation in both theory and practical implementation of support vector machines.
